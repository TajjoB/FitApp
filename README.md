## What is FitApp?

FitApp, written in Python, is a voice recognizing command line program used to calculate your Body Mass Index,
Basal Metabolic Rate and Daily Calories to maintain your current weight. User only has to agree to a disclaimer,
Provide a name, height in inches, weight in pounds and age. Fitapp records the user's voice input, uses Google to
obtain the word and responds to the user.

The Disclaimer ensures that users do not use this program as any actual weight loss goal or anything else.
As a voice-activated automation, this program also prints what was said by the user on the command line. In order to ensure
that FitApp hears what was said, the user must wait until the command line prompts that it is listening. FitApp
will aska a question, then print "Yes or no?", "Height?", "Weight?" or "Age?". User input must be said during
these intervals for the program to hear it.
